# BMCC 2025 Summer AI Workshop

The Computer Information System (CIS) department in the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) is pleased to announce our new summer workshop - Empowering AI: Experiential Learning in AI Application Development. 

As we can expect, many existing applications will evolve into AI-supported systems, creating a substantial demand for talented students who have mastered the unique methodologies and tools required to build these systems. This workshop addresses this critical gap by developing an open-sourced comprehensive codebase that serves as a foundation for AI application development. This modular codebase will include components that teach essential skills, such as:
* Loading and running LLMs
* Utilizing various APIs to access LLMs from providers such as OpenAI, Google, among others.
* Reading, processing, managing data files with various formats and feeding into LLMs.
* Implementing AI agent-based functionalities
* Mastering prompt engineering techniques
