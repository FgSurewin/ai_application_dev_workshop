      "That's a fantastic question – and one that’s been pondered for centuries! The reason the sky is blue is due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Sunlight is Made of All Colors:**\n",
      "* White sunlight is actually composed of all the colors of the rainbow – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. You can see this when light passes through a prism and separates into its constituent colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Scattering by Air Molecules:**\n",
      "* As sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\n",
      "* This collision causes the light to scatter in different directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Rayleigh Scattering Favors Blue Light:**\n",
      "* **Rayleigh scattering** specifically refers to the scattering of electromagnetic radiation (like sunlight) by particles of a much smaller wavelength. \n",
      "* Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths than other colors. Because of this, they are scattered *much* more strongly by the air molecules than red and orange light, which have longer wavelengths. Think of it like this: shorter wavelengths are like little waves bumping into obstacles and bouncing around more easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Why Not Violet?**\n",
      "* While violet light is scattered even more than blue light, our eyes are more sensitive to blue. Also, the sun emits slightly less violet light, and some of the violet light gets absorbed by the upper atmosphere. \n",
      "\n",
      "**In simpler terms:** The blue light gets bounced around all over the sky, making it appear to come from everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it like this analogy:** Imagine throwing a handful of tiny marbles (blue light) and larger, heavier balls (red light) at a bumpy surface. The small marbles would bounce off in all directions, while the large balls would tend to keep going in a more straight line.\n",
